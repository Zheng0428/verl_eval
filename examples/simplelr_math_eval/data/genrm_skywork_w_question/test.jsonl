Maker has a supply of green cubical building blocks, and Breaker has a supply of red ones, all of the same size. On the ground, a row of $m$ squares has been marked in chalk as place-holders. Maker and Breaker now take turns in placing a block either directly on one of these squares, or on top of another block already in place, in such a way that the height of each column never exceeds $n$. Maker places the first block.\nMaker bets that he can form a green row, i.e. all $m$ blocks at a certain height are green. Breaker bets that he can prevent Maker from achieving this.
